### **Glossary**

Underlying token = original token = token

share = derivative token = tenderToken

SharePrice = effectiveSupply(token)/ effectiveSupply(tenderToken)

targetPrice = sharePrice(we use this term to talk about price we are
targeting in the pool =\> we are targeting sharePrice)

tenderPoolPrice = price of tenderToken in pool

effectiveSupply(tenderToken) = totalSupply(tenderToken)
-poolBalance(tenderToken) + mintedForPool(tenderToken)

effectiveSupply(token) = underlyingBalance(token) +
underlyingPooled(token) underlyingStaked(token)

**Problems of Illiquid staking:**
---------------------------------

**Unstaking period**

We want the token to be truly liquid. We use amm pool to achieve this.
We keep a liquid portion of the funds in a pool to keep buffer for
withdrawals.Thus people do not need to wait the unstaking period.

**Liquidifying staking position**

If people stake just by providing funds to a regular staker contract,
their funds are illiquid. By providing people with tenderToken, we allow
them to sell / buy their position freely on secondary market or use it
as collateral.

**Gas Cost savings**

Some of the staking solutions are quite expensive gaswise. Therefore, it
does not make sense for people to stake small amounts of funds. That is
also the reason to "tenderize" their stake .

**Automatic reinvesting of staking rewards**

All staking rewards are automatically reinvested; thus we save gas cost
and time of our fellow crypto comrades.

**System overview**
===================

**Share calculation**
---------------------

### **Calculating share price**

We need to make sure that share price is always calculated correctly.
The goal we need to achieve, is to keep track of all underlying tokens
and make sure that the amount of outstanding shares is correct.

We calculate Outstanding share in the system by calling function:
effectiveSupply(tenderToken) = $T\text{es}$

We keep track of all underlying tokens in the system by calling
function:\
effectiveSupply(token) = $U\text{es}$

Therefore share price = $\text{SP}$ is the result of their division

$$SP = \frac{U\text{es}}{T\text{es}}$$

Whenever there is change in amount of tokens we need to make sure that
the amount of tenderTokens changes accordingly and vice versa. Hence:

$$\frac{Ues_{\text{new}}}{Tes_{\text{new}}} = \frac{Ues_{\text{old}} + \text{Î”U}\text{es}}{Tes_{\text{old}} + \text{Î”T}\text{es}}\text{\ \ }$$

**Staker contract Interactions** 
--------------------------------

### **Deposit**

Alice deposits underlying token (LPT) into the system and gets back
tenderToken (tLPT)

1\. Token is transferred to Staker contract

2\. Based on current shareprice of tenderToken the appropriate amount of
tenderTokens are minted and transferred to Alice

3\. The original token is staked or used for bringing the pool back to
peg:

> a\. token(whole amount or part of) is traded against pool (this is
> done if price of tenderToken in pool is equal or higher than share
> price to keep the peg). The amount received back from the pool is
> burned to keep the share price same since we have already minted
> tokens for received funds
>
> b\. Token is staked, in our case tenderized ðŸ˜‰

**Things to observe:**

Since all withdrawals are done by directly swapping tederToken into the
pool, we need to rebalance the pool so that the tenderToken price in
pool is equal to sharePrice.\
We do this by swapping desired amount of underlyingTokens back to the
pool and staking the rest.\
\
By this mechanism we ensure that withdrawals do not deplete liquidity in
pool. So with every deposit we bring the price in the pool to sharePrice
value so people who withdraw can get fair price, even if nobody trades
against the pool.

#### Token change

$$\frac{\text{Î”U}\text{es}}{\text{Î”T}\text{es}} = \frac{\text{deposit}\left( U \right)}{\text{minted}\left( T \right) + poolOut\left( T \right)\  - burn((poolOut\left( T \right))} = \frac{+ minted\left( T \right)}{+ deposit\left( U \right)}\ $$

Here we mint the amount of tokens based on shareprice multiplied by
deposit. Therefore the share price does not change:

$$\frac{Ues_{\text{new}}}{Tes_{\text{new}}} = \frac{Ues_{\text{old}} + \text{Î”U}\text{es}}{Tes_{\text{old}} + \text{Î”T}\text{es}}\text{\ \ }$$

However, both amounts of underlying tokens and shares increase
proportionally.

### **Withdrawal**

Bob withdraws his original token by providing tenderToken

1\. tenderToken is transferred to Staker contract

2\. Staker swaps whole amount to pool

3\. underlyingToken is sent back to Bob

**Things to observe:**

1.  Bob receives his initial deposit + accrued staking rewards + pool
    rewards -- (pool swap fee + slippage)

2.  By swapping funds to the pool, tenderPoolPrice becomes lower than
    targetPrice, however, the price is brought back up in next deposit.

3.  By this transaction, the value of tenderToken increases slightly
    because the amount of underlying token that is sent out of the pool
    is subtracted by the pool slippage + fee both of which stay in the
    pool.\
    \
    If pool swapped out exactly the amount of tenderTokens times share
    price, this would not be the case, but since some of the funds stay
    in the pool as a fee and slippage, the overall amount of
    tenderTokens outstanding decreases.\
    This is because we substract the pool balance when we calculate the
    amount of outstanding tenderTokens.

#### Token change

$$\frac{\text{Î”U}\text{es}}{\text{Î”T}\text{es}} = \frac{- \ poolOut\left( U \right)\ }{- \ poolIn\left( T \right)}$$

Where $\text{poolOut}\left( U \right)$ amount can be calculated as such:

$$\text{poolOut}\left( U \right) = \ poolIn\left( T \right)*SP\  - poolSlippage\left( T \right)*SP\  - poolFee\left( T \right)*SP\ $$

Therefore the amount of underlying tokens that Bob receives is
subtracted by $\text{poolFee}\left( T \right)$ and
$\text{poolSlippage}\left( T \right)$. Since both fees stay in the pool,
they are not counted towards outstanding shares. Hence the value of one
share in the system increases.

The effect of this is that **all the fees are effectively redistributed
tenderToken holders** who benefit!

**Pool interactions**
---------------------

We establish liquidity pool to allow everyone to be able to exit his
position and get back underlying tokens + rewards without waiting
unstaking period.

### Swap in underlying token

Anyone can swap in underlying token into the pool to get tenderToken.
This makes sense, since there could be a small arbitrage opportunity
thanks to withdrawals which take underlying token out of the pool, thus
making tenderToken cheaper creating arbitrage for tenderToken.

#### Token change

$$\frac{\text{Î”U}\text{es}}{\text{Î”T}\text{es}} = \frac{- \ poolOut\left( U \right)\ }{+ poolIn\left( T \right)}$$

Since we substract pool balance from effectiveSupply of tenderToken,
once anyone swaps tenderToken out of pool, it gets counted towards
effectiveSupply. Thus this is true:

$$- \ \ \text{poolBalance}\left( T \right) = + \ effectiveSupply(T)$$

$$\frac{\text{Î”U}\text{es}}{\text{Î”T}\text{es}} = \frac{+ \ poolIn\left( U \right)}{+ \ effectiveSupply(T)}$$

### Swap in tender token

This is effectively the same as using withdraw().

#### Token change

Same as withdraw()

### **Changing pool liquidity**

For pool to be usable we need to provide initial liquidity for the pool.
As the system grows and there is more daily amounts in deposits /
withdrawals we may decide to use some of the staking rewards to increase
pool liquidity. This would assure lesser slippage for anyone interacting
with the pool.

#### **liquidityIn**

Whenever we increase liquidity in the pool we decrease amount of
effectiveSupply of tenderTokens since we subtract pool balance from
effectiveSupply(see Glossary). For this not to affect share price, we
need to add this amount back to the effective supply.

Also nothing changes for underlying token, since we count both Staker
balance and Pool balance towards effective supply. We only move them
from one location to another.

$\text{Î”T}\text{es} = - \ poolIn\left( T \right) + mint\text{ed}\text{ForPool}\left( T \right) = 0$

#### **liquidityOut** 

Same case as liquidityIn. When we take out liquidity from the pool we
need to subtract tenderTokens taken out of the pool, since we take them
out of the pool thus they become included in the effective supply.

Nothing changes for underlying token, since we count both Staker balance
and Pool balance towards effective supply. We only move them from one
location to another.

$\text{Î”T}\text{es} = + \ poolOut\left( T \right) - \text{mint}\text{ed}\text{ForPool}\left( T \right) = 0$

Possible "untender" scenarios a.k.a. problems
=============================================

Run on liquidity 
----------------

It should be the case that there is net inflow of funds into the system,
since as the system grows more people come into the system hence more
funds are deposited than withdrawn.

However, in the future it may happen that there are more withdrawals
than deposits, thus there is net outflow of funds in the system.\
\
In such a case, the spot price of tenderToken in the pool would move
apart from target price making withdrawals more costly. This would
however create arbitrage opportunity that anyone can take.

There are couple of approaches how we mitigate the problem.

### Arbitrage opportunity to keep the price peg

Firstly by we allow anyone to unstake, by providing tenderTokens to the
Staker contract, which will unstake the tokens for the participant and
sends him the underlying tokens once the unstaking period has passed.\
\
We do not actually expect people to unstake themselves even though they
could, but this incentify arbitragers or anybody able and willing to
provide liquidity. They would buy tenderTokens for less than shareprice
from the pool, unstake them while hedging for the price movement of the
underlying asset during the unstaking period and pocket the difference.

### Manual rebalancing 

If from whatever reason there are no arbitragers willing to take the
arbitrage opportunity, governance can decide to unstake tokens to
rebalance the pool.

In practice this would work accordingly:

1.  Governance decides to rebalance the pool, if there is too little
    underlying tokens in the pool and arbitrage does not happen.

2.  Previous pool state =\> share price = 0.8, target price = 1 =\> 800
    / 1000 (token / tenderToken) in pool

3.  rebalance to 800 / 800 (this lowers pool liquidity but brings the
    price back up to target)

4.  unstake 200 underlying tokens

5.  once unstaked funds are liquid, rebalance pool back to 1000/1000
